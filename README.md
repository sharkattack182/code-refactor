            This was my very first project in my bootcamp for UNCC. The objective was to clean up the existing code and
            organize everything so that the page's html and css were easy to read for anyone working on the code in the future.             
        </p>
        <p>
            As I made changes I constantly pushed the changes into GitLab to hilight the entire process. As you can see
            I first started by cleaning up the html deleting any unnecessary tags and adding semantic elements. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the html was cleaned up I went in and started to organize the css. The I noticed many of the elements that had been 
            assigned classes had the same css styling so I decided to style the elements with one command.
        </p>
        <p>
            Like I said it was my first project and it was challenging but fun. I look forward to looking back on this and remembering my 
            very first assignment in web development.
